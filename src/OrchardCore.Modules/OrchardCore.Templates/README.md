# Templates (OrchardCore.Templates)

The templates module allows editors to create custom Liquid templates.

## Available templates

Templates can be defined using the web editor, or in a theme. Templates are distinguished by their name. 
Orchard Core doesn't render HTML directly, but instead will usually render something called a **Shape**, which is an object that represents
the thing to render and has all the necessary data and metatada to render HTML.

When rendering a Shape, Orchard Core will eventually look for specific templates, passing the Shape to this template. Orchard Core can match with many templates
for the same Shape. This potential templates are called **Alternates**. A Shape contains a list of acceptable template names (the alternates) and will look into
providers to get the most appropriate one. For instance when rendering a Content Item of type Article, the corresponding Shape that is rendered will be configured
to look for a template that handles all articles, but also one that handles an article when used in a list, and so on.

This document provides a list of pre-defined templates that can be used when rendering shapes. It uses the internal name of a template and also the filename
in case it's provided by a Theme.
